Don't Use Mutable Types As Default Values!

It is dangerous to use a mutable type (eg a list, dictionary) as a default value, because on repeated calls to the function, a new default value will not be allocated!

Check out the following sample code:
def f(x, myList = []):
    myList.append(x)
    return myList
>>> f(6)
[6]
>>> f(10)
[6, 10]


The correct, "Pythonic" way to write this code would be:
def f(x, myList = None):
    if myList == None:
        # This WILL allocate a new list on every call to the function.
        myList = []
    myList.append(x)
    return myList
>>> f(6)
[6]
>>> f(10)
[10]
